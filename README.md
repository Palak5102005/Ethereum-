# Ethereum DEX  

A simple **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)** built on Ethereum that enables users to **deposit, withdraw, and manage balances of ERC-20 tokens**.  
This project demonstrates how smart contracts, frontend applications, and blockchain deployment come together to create a working decentralized trading platform.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📦 **Deposit & Withdraw** – Secure ERC-20 token transfers managed by smart contracts.  
- 💸 **Exchange Fees** – Supports fee collection by the DEX operator.  
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode** – Modern frontend with theme toggle for better user experience.  
- 🌍 **Goerli Testnet** – Fully functional on an active Ethereum testnet.  
- 🛡 **Secure & Auditable** – Built with Solidity ^0.8.0 and OpenZeppelin libraries.
